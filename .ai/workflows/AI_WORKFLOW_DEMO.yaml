        Based on the analysis in artifacts/ai-refactor-plan.json,
        implement the highest priority refactoring suggestions.
        Focus on:
        1. Extracting complex methods
        2. Improving type hints
        3. Adding docstrings where missing
        4. Simplifying conditional logic
