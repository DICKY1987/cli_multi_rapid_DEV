"""
CLI Multi-Rapid: Deterministic, Schema-Driven CLI Orchestrator

A deterministic, schema-driven CLI orchestrator that stitches together multiple
developer tools and AI agents into predefined, auditable workflows. It prioritizes
scripts first, escalates to AI only where judgment is required, and emits
machine-readable artifacts (patches, reports, logs) with gates and verification
at every hop.
