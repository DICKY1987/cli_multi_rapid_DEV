# Autonomous Multi-Update Branch System

Strategy: accumulate validated updates on a dedicated branch and auto-merge when thresholds are met.

Key components:
- Scheduled or dispatch-triggered updates
- Threshold-based merge policy
- Pre-merge validation and rollback tags

See `.github/workflows/autonomous_updates.yml` (planned) for full automation.
