# Phase Plan â€” Integrated with Overall Implementation

> This document integrates the status/evaluation from **Overall Implementation.md** into the execution roadmap defined in **Phase_Plan.md**. It keeps the original phase plan intact and adds a status baseline, a crosswalk from recommendationsâ†’phases, and a few additive subâ€‘phases to cover gaps (P_ folder integration, compliance monitoring & remediation, and legacy bridge).

---

## Status Baseline (from â€œOverall Implementation.mdâ€)

### Major Accomplishments (âœ…)
- **Microservices Architecture (100%)** â€” 17 services implemented with Docker Compose, schema registry, and modern FastAPI/Redis patterns.
- **Testing Framework (95%)** â€” Integration tests, contract validation with golden fixtures, performance/tick replay, and E2E pipeline tests.
- **Configuration Management (90%)** â€” Poetry, envâ€‘based configuration, Docker Compose; Makefile ops.
- **Documentation & Standards (85%)** â€” CLAUDE.md, perâ€‘service READMEs, and consistent patterns.

### Partially Addressed (âš ï¸)
- **P_ Folder Integration (60%)** â€” P_* content not fully merged (e.g., P_positioning_ratio_index, P_GUI, P_INDICATOR_REENTRY).
- **Crossâ€‘Language Standards (40%)** â€” Limited PowerShell/MQL4 integration; SQL standards not unified.
- **Realâ€‘Time Compliance Monitoring (30%)** â€” No live compliance dashboards, autoâ€‘remediation, or emergency recovery runbooks.

### Not Addressed (âŒ)
- **Standards Enforcement Framework** â€” preâ€‘commit enforcement, CI/CD compliance gates.
- **Crossâ€‘Language Bridge** â€” robust bridge across Python â‡„ MQL4 â‡„ PowerShell, unified config/errâ€‘handling.
- **Productionâ€‘Readiness** â€” emergency recovery procedures, realâ€‘time perf monitoring with alerts, automated rollback.

### Recommendations (ðŸŽ¯)
1) **P_ Folder Content Integration** (audit/migrate/map/update imports).
2) **Standards Framework** (compliance service, preâ€‘commit, CI gates).
3) **Bridge Integration** (legacy bridge, unified config propagation, crossâ€‘system health checks).

---

## Crosswalk: Recommendations â†” Phases in this Plan

- **P_ Folder Integration â†’ _New Phase 2A_** (runs parallel to Phase 2).
- **Standards Enforcement & Compliance â†’ _Extend Phase 3_ and _New Phase 5A_** (CI gates plus live compliance & remediation).
- **Legacy Bridge / Crossâ€‘Language Integration â†’ _New Phase 7A_** (after initial K8s path).
- **Emergency Recovery / Rollback â†’ _Augment Phase 6_ (release) and _Phase 10_ (runbooks)**.

---

## Phases

> Phases 0â€“12 below preserve the structure and intent of the original plan, with targeted additions where noted.

### Phase 0 â€” Project Baseline & Branch Protection (Day 0)

**Goal:** lock in a safe working baseline and guardrails.
**Why:** prevents drift during the hardening work.

**Tasks**
- Protect default branch (PRs required, linear history, status checks).
- Create working branch `rel/v0.1.0-hardening`.
- Add Taskfile/Makefile with **up/test/lint/build/sbom/release:dry**.
- Enable Issues & Projects for tracking.


#### Scope
- Repository baseline, branch protection, formatting and hooks
- No service logic changes; scaffolding and guardrails only

#### Deliverables
- .pre-commit-config.yaml installed and enforced
- CODEOWNERS and branch protection on main with required checks
- Makefile baseline targets wired

#### Milestones
- Day 0: Baseline config merged to main
- Day 0: Branch protection applied

#### Dependencies
- GitHub admin permissions to set protection rules
- Developer machines with pre-commit installed

#### Risks & Mitigations
- Misconfigured required checks can block merges | Mitigation: dry-run on a staging branch then apply
- Secrets committed by mistake | Mitigation: enable secret scanning, add pre-commit secrets hook
**Acceptance**
- Protected default branch; feature branches via PR only.
- `task up` brings up current compose stack.

**Deliverables** â€” Branch protection, Taskfile/Makefile.
**Effort/Deps** â€” 0.5 day; none.

---

### Phase 1 â€” Repo Hygiene & Legal (Day 1)

**Goal:** formalize licensing, contribution, ownership, and support paths.
**Why:** legal clarity and faster code review.

**Tasks**
- Add **LICENSE (MIT)** to match README claim.
- Add **.github/**: CODEOWNERS, CONTRIBUTING.md, SECURITY.md, issue templates.

- Repository admin to enable security features

#### Risks & Mitigations
- License mismatch with upstream components | Mitigation: audit dependencies and align on MIT compatibility
- Bot PR noise | Mitigation: group updates and schedule windows
**Acceptance**
- LICENSE recognized by GitHub; issue templates in effect; PRs route via CODEOWNERS.

**Deliverables** â€” `/LICENSE`, `/.github/*`, `/docs/README.md`.
**Effort/Deps** â€” 0.5â€“1 day; Phase 0 complete.

---

### Phase 2 â€” Canonical Contracts & Codegen (Days 2â€“4)

**Goal:** JSON Schemas become singleâ€‘sourceâ€‘ofâ€‘truth for all contracts.
**Why:** prevent Pythonâ‡„MQL4 drift and runtime failures.

**Tasks**
- Define schemas under `/contracts/events/`: `PriceTick@1.0`, `IndicatorVector@1.1`, `Signal@1.0`, `OrderIntent@1.2`, `ExecutionReport@1.0`, `CalendarEvent@1.0`, `ReentryDecision@1.0`.
- Generate Python models (Pydantic v2) into each service.
- Add MQL4 helpers: `/P_mql4/helpers/contract_parsers.mq4` for schemaâ€‘aware parse/serialize with numeric/text safety.
- Roundâ€‘trip golden tests in `/P_tests/contracts/`: JSON â†’ Py â†’ JSON; JSON â†’ MQL4 â†’ JSON.
- Document in `docs/modernization/01_service_catalog.md`.


#### Scope
- Define canonical contracts (JSON, CSV) and validators; integrate with tests and CI

#### Deliverables
- contracts/schemas/*.json plus validation scripts (contracts/validate_json_schemas.py)
- CSV models and validators (contracts/models/csv_models.py, validate_csv_artifacts.py)
- CI wiring via ci/validate_schemas.py and tests/contracts

**Acceptance**
- Schema change fails tests until models/helpers regenerated.
- Python & MQL4 roundâ€‘trip tests pass.

**Deliverables** â€” `/contracts/events/*.json`, generated models, helpers, tests.
**Effort/Deps** â€” 2â€“3 days; Phases 0â€“1.

---

**Goal:** integrate P_* content into the main codebase.
**Why:** remove duplication and align legacy assets with contracts & services.

**Tasks**
- Audit all **P_** folders (e.g., `P_positioning_ratio_index`, `P_GUI`, `P_INDICATOR_REENTRY`).
- Migrate missing components to canonical locations (e.g., `/shared/reentry/`, `/src/eafix/positioning/`, GUI assets into `gui-gateway`).
- Update imports, configs, and docs references; remove obsolete copies.
- Add smoke tests for migrated modules; update Taskfile targets.

**Acceptance**
- No dangling imports; P_* functionality accessible via services.

**Why:** repeatable, provable builds.

**Tasks**
- **preâ€‘commit**: ruff, black, mypy `--strict`, detectâ€‘secrets (baseline committed).
- **ci.yml**: matrix (Py 3.11/3.12), run preâ€‘commit, unit + contract tests, build images.
- **buildâ€‘publish.yml**: on tag `v*`, build perâ€‘service images, **SBOM (Syft)**, **scan (Grype)**, **sign (Cosign)**, push to GHCR.
- **release.yml**: create GitHub Release with conventionalâ€‘commit notes; attach SBOMs.
- Require CI checks in branch protection.


#### Scope
- CI for tests, lint, type-check; CD hooks for container builds where applicable

#### Deliverables

**Goal:** reduce supplyâ€‘chain and secret risks.
**Why:** trading systems are highâ€‘value targets.

- Surface **live dashboards** (Grafana panels) for compliance posture; emit alerts on drift.
- Wire **autoâ€‘remediation hooks** (e.g., open PRs to bump schema/model versions, revert insecure config, quarantine images without SBOM/signature).
- Draft **Emergency Recovery Procedures**: how to pause trading safely, rollback images, drain queues, and recover state.
- Export **compliance rules** as JSON consumed by CI (Phase 3) to enforce **PR gates**.

**Acceptance**
- Deliberate rule violation triggers alert and CI failure.
- Tabletop â€œemergency rollbackâ€ succeeds per runbook.
