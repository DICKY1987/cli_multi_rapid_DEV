 Objective

  - Deliver an enterprise-grade completion plan for the repository, aligned
  to the “Project Completion Orchestrator v3.0” prompt you shared. I used
  strictness=high, self_check_passes=3, and completion_mode=comprehensive.

  Context & Inputs

  - Repo: cli_multi_rapid_DEV
  - Current state:
      - Orchestrator and phases exist; added “local readiness” stream
  (stream-complete) and validation phase.
      - CI added (core+extended) on Ubuntu.
      - Fixes applied: lib/gdw_runner stub; lib/cost_tracker docstring fix;
  optional imports for fastapi/redis/jwt; validation tests added.
      - Open PR (clean off main): https://github.com/DICKY1987/
  cli_multi_rapid_DEV/pull/14
      - Known gaps tracked in issues: #9–#13.

  Gap Analysis

  - Ambiguity
      - CLI scope vs. “EAFIX” domain references partially overlap (risk of
  scope drift).
      - Inconsistent Windows vs. Linux behavior not fully documented.
      - Benchmarks/integration tests vs. core tests boundary undefined.
  - Logical Process
      - Phase execution works; dependency checks and skip logic inconsistent
  across OS.
      - Decision points for test gating and coverage thresholds per-lane
  not codified.
  - Architecture & Vulnerabilities
      - Tests reference missing modules (now stubbed), rely on optional
  services (fastapi/redis).
      - Extended suite coverage below 85% (CI extended is non-blocking).
      - Pre-push gate requires rebase; contributors need clear “lane”
  instructions.
  - Requirements Decomposition
      - Clear acceptance for core readiness exists; extended/integration
  acceptance criteria need codification (marks/fixtures).
      - Traceability: link tests, phases, CI jobs to explicit success
  criteria.
  - Operational Context
      - Local developer workflows need consistent runners and PYTHONPATH
  setup.
      - CI on Ubuntu is the source of truth; Windows local path should be
  resilient.
  - Task Error Recovery
      - Workflows have dry-run; no explicit rollback docs for config/script
  changes.
      - CI retry and lane-based PR rules exist; needs contributor-facing
  runbook.

  Roadmap (Phased)

  - Phase A: Foundation Stabilization
      - Goals: resolve blockers, harden tests/CI, codify OS variance.
      - Work Streams:
      - Test hygiene: mark integration/benchmark tests; add
  `pytest.importorskip` where appropriate; ensure missing modules or stubs
  exist; fix brittle imports.
      - CI lanes: ensure core job blocks; extended continues-on-error, with
  a path to tighten later.
      - Requirements: add Windows guard for semgrep (done), document
  platform differences.
      - Docs: contributor quickstart, PYTHONPATH guidance; local run
  scripts.
  - Success Criteria:
      - Core CI green; local stream `stream-complete` green; extended CI
  surfaces ≤ 3 minors.
      - No import-time failures across OS for core paths.
  - Phase B: Core Feature Development
      - Goals: complete orchestrator feature set with deterministic+AI
  routing and policy gates.
      - Work Streams:
      - Orchestrator: enrich templates, expand phases, add policy-driven
  routing; finalize stream scopes and gating.
      - Cost tracking: coverage and test fixtures for cost paths; outputs in
  `artifacts/`.
      - Integrations: clarify external deps (fastapi/redis); add mocks/
  fixtures for local runs.
  - Success Criteria:
      - ≥ 90% coverage for orchestrator/core modules; workflows validated;
  artifacts generated consistently.
  - Phase C: Production Readiness
      - Goals: containerized pipeline and security posture.
      - Work Streams:
      - CI/CD: build and publish container (Dockerfile present); SBOM +
  signing; matrix tests.
      - Security: CodeQL (already added), secret scanning; pinned
  dependencies; vulnerability scanning.
      - Observability: structured logs; minimal dashboards/templates linked;
  prometheus exporter where applicable.
  - Success Criteria:
      - Release pipeline runs on tags; SBOM/cosign artifacts attached;
      - scorecards pass.
  - Phase D: Launch & Stabilization
      - Goals: documentation, support, and steady-state quality.
      - Work Streams:
      - Docs & runbooks: developer onboarding, incident response, release
  playbooks.
      - Feedback loop: PR templates; coverage thresholds ratchet up;
  performance tracking.
  - Success Criteria:
      - Full production pipeline validated; user docs available; <1% error
      - rate under normal cycles.
