## The Symbiotic Coder: How Claude and OpenAI CLIs Can Work in Autonomous Harmony

In the rapidly evolving landscape of AI-powered software development, the Claude CLI tool, known as **Claude Code**, and the **OpenAI CLI tool (Codex CLI)** are emerging as powerful command-line allies for developers. While both tools offer distinct advantages, their true potential can be unlocked when they work in concert, creating autonomous workflows that streamline complex coding tasks. This synergy stems from their complementary strengths: Claude's deep contextual understanding and reasoning versus OpenAI's flexibility, granular control, and open-source nature.

### At a Glance: Strengths of Each Tool

| Feature | Claude CLI (Claude Code) | OpenAI CLI (Codex CLI) |
|---|---|---|
| **Core Strength** | Deep contextual understanding of entire codebases, long-form reasoning, and planning complex changes. | High level of user control, configurability, and flexibility through an open-source framework. |
| **Best For** | - **Codebase comprehension:** Understanding complex project structures and dependencies. \<br\> - **Automated refactoring:** Performing large-scale changes across multiple files with a coherent plan. \<br\> - **Generating greenfield projects:** Scaffolding new applications from a high-level description. \<br\> - **In-depth bug analysis:** Tracing the root cause of complex issues. | - **Targeted code generation:** Creating specific functions or code blocks based on precise instructions. \<br\> - **Unit test generation:** Quickly writing tests for existing code. \<br\> - **Scripting and automation:** Easily integrating into shell scripts and custom workflows. \<br\> - **Data manipulation and analysis:** Generating scripts for processing data files. |
| **Autonomous Operation** | More "agent-like," can be given high-level goals and will break them down into steps, but requires more initial setup of its environment and permissions. | More of a "toolkit" that can be precisely directed. Its different approval modes (suggest, auto-edit, full-auto) allow for fine-tuned autonomous execution. |

### The Autonomous Alliance: Forging Workflows

The key to making these tools work together autonomously lies in leveraging a higher-level scripting language, such as Bash or Python, to orchestrate their interactions. This "conductor" script can invoke one tool, capture its output, and then use that output to inform the actions of the other.

Here are some powerful autonomous workflows that combine the strengths of both the Claude and OpenAI CLI tools:

-----

### Workflow 1: From High-Level Feature to Tested Code

In this workflow, Claude Code is used for its strategic planning and codebase-aware code generation, while the OpenAI Codex CLI excels at the more granular task of generating precise unit tests for the newly created code.

**Objective:** Autonomously add a new feature to an existing project, including writing the necessary unit tests.

**Steps:**

1.  **Initiation (Manual or CI Trigger):** A developer or a CI/CD pipeline triggers a master script with a high-level feature request, for example: "Implement a user authentication endpoint that accepts a username and password and returns a JWT."

2.  **Claude Code: Strategic Implementation:** The master script invokes the Claude CLI with a prompt to implement the feature. Claude will:

      * Analyze the existing codebase to understand the project structure, coding conventions, and existing dependencies.
      * Formulate a plan for implementation, potentially creating new files or modifying existing ones.
      * Generate the necessary code for the authentication endpoint, including request handling, password hashing, and JWT generation.

3.  **Output Capture and Handoff:** The master script captures the paths of the newly created or modified files from Claude's output.

4.  **OpenAI Codex CLI: Precision Unit Testing:** The script then iterates through the new/modified files and invokes the OpenAI CLI for each one with a targeted prompt, such as: "Generate comprehensive unit tests for the functions in 'auth_controller.py'." The OpenAI tool, with its full-auto approval mode, will:

      * Generate the unit test code.
      * Write it to a new test file (e.g., test_auth_controller.py).

5.  **Execution and Validation:** The master script can then run the newly generated tests to validate the feature implementation.

**Autonomous Interaction:** The script acts as the autonomous agent, seamlessly passing the baton from Claude's high-level implementation to OpenAI's focused testing, without human intervention.

-----

### Workflow 2: Automated Refactoring and Documentation

This workflow leverages Claude's ability to understand and refactor large codebases, followed by OpenAI's proficiency in generating concise documentation.

**Objective:** Autonomously refactor a complex module for better readability and then generate corresponding documentation.

**Steps:**

1.  **Trigger:** A developer initiates a script with a refactoring goal, for instance: "Refactor the 'data_processing.py' module to improve modularity and adherence to PEP 8 standards."

2.  **Claude Code: Deep Refactoring:** The script calls the Claude CLI to perform the refactoring. Claude will:

      * Analyze the entire data_processing.py file and its interactions with other parts of the codebase.
      * Break down large functions into smaller, more manageable ones.
      * Rename variables for clarity and ensure the code is well-structured.

3.  **OpenAI Codex CLI: Documentation Generation:** Once the refactoring is complete, the script invokes the OpenAI CLI on the refactored file with a prompt like: "Generate clear and concise docstrings for all functions in 'data_processing.py'."

4.  **Final Touches (Optional):** The script could even use a final call to another tool or a simple script to format the generated documentation into a Markdown file for a project's docs folder.

**Autonomous Interaction:** This workflow automates the often tedious process of refactoring and then bringing the documentation up to date, ensuring code quality and maintainability.

-----

### Workflow 3: Cross-Language Task Automation

This workflow demonstrates how the two tools can collaborate on a task that spans different programming languages, with each tool handling the language it excels at for a given task.

**Objective:** Autonomously create a Python backend endpoint and a corresponding JavaScript frontend fetch request.

**Steps:**

1.  **Initiation:** A script is triggered with the goal: "Create a Python Flask endpoint '/api/data' that returns a JSON object, and a JavaScript function to fetch data from this endpoint."

2.  **Claude Code: Backend Development:** The script first calls the Claude CLI with a focus on the Python backend, providing it with the project context. Claude generates the Flask route and necessary Python code.

3.  **OpenAI Codex CLI: Frontend Snippet:** The script then uses the OpenAI CLI for the more focused task of creating the JavaScript snippet, with a prompt like: "Write a JavaScript async function using the Fetch API to make a GET request to '/api/data' and log the JSON response."

**Autonomous Interaction:** The script orchestrates the creation of a full-stack feature by delegating the backend and frontend development to the AI tool best suited for each part of the task in this context.

### The Future is Collaborative

By understanding the unique strengths of both the Claude and OpenAI CLI tools, developers can move beyond using them as standalone assistants and begin to architect sophisticated, autonomous workflows. This collaborative approach, orchestrated by simple scripts, has the potential to significantly accelerate development cycles, improve code quality, and free up developers to focus on higher-level architectural and creative problem-solving. As these tools continue to evolve, the possibilities for their autonomous collaboration will only expand.

Love this framing. You’ve captured the “why” really well. Below are quick upgrades + a drop-in orchestration starter so you can run the symbiosis, not just describe it.

Quick accuracy & naming tweaks

Call it “OpenAI Codex CLI” (a.k.a. codex) rather than “OpenAI CLI.” It’s an open-source coding agent CLI from OpenAI with configurable approval modes (Suggest / Auto-Edit / Full-Auto).
GitHub
OpenAI Developers
DataCamp

Claude Code is Anthropic’s agentic coding CLI that edits files, runs commands, and can raise PRs; it’s scriptable and integrates with MCP servers and common dev tools.
Anthropic
Anthropic

Your strengths table is broadly right; I’d add:

Claude Code = codebase-scale planning + multi-step edits, strong repo intelligence.
Anthropic

Codex CLI = fine-grained autonomy controls, clean config (~/.codex/config.toml), first-class MCP integration.
GitHub

Guardrails that make autonomy safe

Git sandboxing: run on a throwaway branch/worktree; auto-stash and commit every agent change.

Directory allowlist: keep both tools confined to ./src, ./tests, etc. (Codex “Full-Auto” still stays within the working dir; Claude has per-tool permissions you can keep strict).
OpenAI Developers
Anthropic

Approval modes by phase: planning/editing = Claude; unit-test gen = Codex in Auto-Edit; shell commands in Suggest unless CI.
OpenAI Developers

Hard timeouts & cost ceilings (env vars), and a red-line command denylist (e.g., rm -rf, curl | bash).

A simple handoff contract (so tools “speak JSON”)

Have Claude always emit a machine-readable delta:

{
  "plan": "...short summary...",
  "changed_files": ["src/auth_controller.py", "src/jwt_utils.py"],
  "followups": ["add tests for edge cases: expired token, bad signature"]
}


Your conductor script consumes changed_files and asks Codex to generate tests for those paths.

Optional: MCP servers to supercharge both

If you want, I can tailor the orchestrator to your repo layout (e.g., eafix-modular), add a PowerShell wrapper for Windows, and drop in pytest scaffolds for a real demo.

Thought for 1m 42s

Great question—here’s the plain-English version:

That line means: both tools (Claude Code and OpenAI’s Codex CLI) can plug into the Model Context Protocol (MCP)—an open standard that lets AI agents talk to outside systems (GitHub, issue trackers, databases, your File Alchemist tools) through standard “servers.” When you “wire servers,” you register those connectors so the agent can fetch data or call actions without you pasting giant prompts.
Model Context Protocol
Anthropic

Quick mental model

MCP server = an adapter that exposes resources (data like files/DB schemas) and tools (actions like “create PR”).
Model Context Protocol

MCP client = your agent/CLI (Claude Code or Codex) that connects to those servers.
GitHub

Why you’d do this

No prompt stuffing: the agent pulls exactly what it needs (e.g., “@github:issue/123” or “@postgres:schema://users”).
Anthropic

Repeatable & secure: same config works for teammates/CI, and access is permissioned per server.
Anthropic

How to “wire” one (both CLIs)

Claude Code: add a server via its CLI or JSON. Example pattern:

# Add an MCP server from a JSON config (stdio example)
claude mcp add-json weather-api '{
  "type":"stdio",
  "command":"/path/to/weather-cli",
  "args":["--api-key","ABC123"],
  "env":{"CACHE_DIR":"/tmp"}
}'
# Verify
claude mcp get weather-api


Claude then lets you @-reference that server’s resources in prompts.
Anthropic
+1

Codex CLI (OpenAI): enable MCP by editing ~/.codex/config.toml and adding a server block:

[mcp_servers.my_server]
command = "npx"
args = ["-y", "my-mcp-server", "--project", "/path/to/repo"]
env = { MY_TOKEN = "xxxxx" }


Codex will launch that server and make its resources/tools available to the agent.
GitHub

Examples of what you can wire

GitHub (issues/PRs/reviews as tools & resources)

Issue trackers (e.g., Jira)

Local/remote DBs (e.g., Postgres schemas/queries as resources/tools)

Your “File Alchemist” as a custom MCP server exposing tools like classify, convert, fix_extension, plus resources like audit_log://latest. (You’d implement it using an MCP SDK and point both CLIs at it.)
GitHub

Using it in a prompt (Claude Code style)

You can literally reference resources inline:

Compare @postgres:schema://users with @docs:file://database/user-model


Claude auto-fetches and attaches those to the request—no manual copy/paste.
Anthropic

Reality check on support

Claude Code: official MCP client support (including remote servers).
Anthropic
Anthropic

Codex CLI: MCP is supported via mcp_servers in its config (open-source repo docs).
GitHub

If you want, I can sketch a tiny MCP server interface for File Alchemist (endpoints + example config) so both CLIs can call it the same way.

What do you think about this : Of course. While the Claude and OpenAI CLI tools are powerful for code generation and reasoning, a truly autonomous development workflow requires a robust ecosystem of specialized open-source CLI tools to handle validation, enforcement, and integration. These tools act as the essential "scaffolding" around the AI's creative work, ensuring the generated code is clean, secure, and well-managed.

Here are several categories of open-source CLI tools that perfectly complement the AI duo, along with specific examples:

### 1\. Code Quality, Formatting, and Linting

These tools enforce coding standards and consistency, which is crucial when code is being generated by an AI. They act as the automated style guide and quality check.

  * **Tool:** **Ruff** (for Python)

      * **Strength:** An extremely fast Python linter and code formatter, written in Rust. It can replace dozens of older tools like Flake8, isort, and Black.
      * **How it Complements:** After Claude generates a new Python module or OpenAI adds a function, a script can autonomously run ruff format . and ruff check --fix . to instantly reformat the code to project standards and automatically fix hundreds of common linting errors.

  * **Tool:** **Prettier** (for JavaScript, TypeScript, HTML, CSS, etc.)

      * **Strength:** An opinionated code formatter that supports numerous languages. It removes all original styling and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style.
      * **How it Complements:** In a workflow where an AI generates a new React component, Prettier can be called immediately to format the JSX, CSS, and any associated JavaScript, ensuring it matches the rest of the codebase without any manual intervention.

### 2\. Static and Security Analysis

These tools go deeper than linters to find potential bugs, security vulnerabilities, and complex code quality issues before the code is even run.

  * **Tool:** **Semgrep**

      * **Strength:** A powerful, multi-language static analysis tool. It uses a simple grep-like syntax to find complex code patterns. It's excellent for enforcing security best practices and project-specific rules.
      * **How it Complements:** Imagine Claude refactors a section of code that handles database queries. A workflow can automatically trigger a Semgrep scan (semgrep --config=auto .) on the changed files to check for common injection vulnerabilities or other security flaws that the AI might have inadvertently introduced.

  * **Tool:** **Bandit** (for Python)

      * **Strength:** Specifically designed to find common security issues in Python code.
      * **How it Complements:** After OpenAI's CLI generates a script for file handling or network requests, Bandit can be run to quickly check for issues like hardcoded passwords, insecure temporary file creation, or unsafe YAML loading.

### 3\. High-Speed Search and Navigation

While AI can understand context, sometimes a workflow needs to perform raw, high-speed searches to find specific tokens, function calls, or configuration values.

  * **Tool:** **ripgrep (rg)**
      * **Strength:** A line-oriented search tool that is significantly faster than traditional tools like grep. It recursively searches your current directory for a regex pattern while respecting .gitignore.
      * **How it Complements:** An orchestration script could use ripgrep to quickly find all instances of a deprecated function call across a massive codebase. This list of files and line numbers could then be fed directly to the Claude CLI as a manifest for a targeted, automated refactoring task.

### 4\. Version Control and Automation

The cornerstone of any development workflow, these tools manage the changes made by the AI.

  * **Tool:** **Git CLI**

      * **Strength:** The fundamental tool for version control.
      * **How it Complements:** The git CLI is the glue that finalizes the autonomous workflow. After AI tools generate code, linters format it, and scanners approve it, a script uses git commands (git add, git commit) to save the work. The commit message itself could even be generated by a final, quick call to the OpenAI CLI summarizing the changes.

  * **Tool:** **just**

      * **Strength:** A handy command runner that provides a simpler, more portable alternative to make. It's great for defining and running project-specific commands.
      * **How it Complements:** You can create a justfile that defines the entire autonomous workflow, chaining all the tools together under a single, memorable command like just add-feature "Create a user profile page". This command would then execute the sequence of calls to Claude, Prettier, Semgrep, and Git.

-----

### Example: An Advanced Autonomous Workflow

Here’s how these tools can work together in a single, autonomous chain:

1.  **Trigger:** A developer runs a single command:


bash
    just add-feature --description "Add API endpoint for user data export in CSV format"


2.  **Claude CLI (Reasoning & Generation):** The just script calls Claude to analyze the codebase and generate the primary files for the new feature (e.g., export_controller.py, user_service_update.py).

3.  **OpenAI CLI (Targeted Addition):** The script identifies the new controller file and calls the OpenAI CLI to generate a suite of unit tests for it.

4.  **Ruff (Linting & Formatting):** The script runs ruff format . and ruff check --fix . on the newly created and modified files to ensure they are clean and conform to project style.

5.  **Semgrep (Security Scan):** The script then runs semgrep on the changed files to check for security issues, particularly around data handling and file generation. If vulnerabilities are found, the process could halt and report the issue.

6.  **Git CLI (Version Control):** If all checks pass, the script uses git add . to stage the new files and then runs git commit -m "feat: Add user data export endpoint". The commit message could even be refined by a final AI call.

In this vision, the AI tools (Claude, OpenAI) are the "thinkers" and "creators," while the open-source CLI ecosystem provides the essential "assembly line" of validation, formatting, and integration, enabling a truly robust and autonomous development process.

This is 🔥. You’ve got the right mental model: Claude/Codex “think & write,” the OSS CLI stack “guards & polishes.” I’d keep your write-up and layer a few upgrades so it’s production-safe and repeatable.

What’s great

Clear categories (format → scan → commit) and concrete tools (Ruff, Prettier, Semgrep, Bandit, ripgrep, Git, just).

The “one command runs the chain” idea is spot on for solo-dev velocity.

Gaps worth adding

Type-safety & API surface

Python: mypy or pyright (fast, catches whole classes of bugs AI can miss).

JS/TS: eslint + tsc --noEmit.

Schema guards: check-jsonschema for JSON/YAML (lock your config contracts).

Secrets & supply chain

Gitleaks (or TruffleHog) to stop secret commits.

OSV-Scanner / pip-audit / npm audit for dependency vulns.

SBOM: syft → scan with grype or trivy (especially if you containerize).

Docs & consistency

codespell + markdownlint (or mdformat) to keep prose clean.

Autogen docs: MkDocs Material or Sphinx gatekept by CI.

Testing depth

Coverage gate: pytest --cov=src --cov-fail-under=85.

Property-based tests: hypothesis for tricky logic.

Mutation testing (optional but powerful): mutmut (py) or Stryker (js).

Policy & release hygiene

pre-commit is your enforcement backbone (runs everything locally & in CI).

Conventional Commits via commitlint or commitizen so changelogs and semantic versioning are automatic.

Safer automation rails

Git worktree/throwaway branch + directory allowlist for agents.

Hard denylist (rm -rf, curl | bash) + timeouts and token caps.

Two-lane pipeline (fast local vs. heavy CI)

Lane A – Local (fast feedback)

pre-commit: Ruff (format+lint), Prettier, eslint/tsc, mypy/pyright, check-jsonschema, yamllint, codespell, gitleaks.

just add-feature "…" → Claude implement → Codex tests → format/lint.

Lane B – CI (heavier gates)

Repeat Lane A + Semgrep, Bandit, coverage gate, OSV scan, optional SBOM scan.

Block merge on any failure.

Tiny workflow refinement to your example

After step 3 (tests generated), add:

Type check: pyright / mypy.

Coverage gate: fail if <85%.

Secret & vuln scan: gitleaks, osv-scanner.

Conventional commit: generate message via AI but validate with commitlint.

Why this matters for your projects

Your repos (e.g., eafix-modular, File Alchemist, HUEY_P) benefit from deterministic gates: AI can propose big edits, but the hooks decide if it ships.

Pre-commit + just give you muscle memory: the same command locally and in CI.

Adding type checks + property-based tests pays off in your trading logic and CSV/indicator validators where edge cases are costly.

If you want, I can tailor these snippets to your repo structure (paths, schemas, TS presence) and fold them into a ready PR with a just add-feature demo.

You said:
This is a really solid foundation - you've nailed the core architecture of AI agents + deterministic gates. Here's my assessment with tactical improvements to make it production-optimal:
What's Already Excellent
✅ The mental model is perfect: AI tools as "thinkers/creators" → OSS tools as "validators/enforcers"
✅ Tool selection is smart: Ruff + Semgrep + ripgrep are best-in-class
✅ Git safety + just orchestration: Critical for reversibility and repeatability
Key Optimizations for Production
1. Shift the Security Left (Earlier)
Problem: Running Semgrep after AI generation means you're catching issues late.
Fix: Pre-flight security constraints:
python# BEFORE calling Claude/Codex, scan the context
def preflight_security_check(feature_desc):
    # Extract security-sensitive patterns from feature description
    if any(word in feature_desc.lower() for word in ['auth', 'password', 'token', 'api_key', 'encrypt']):
        # Inject security requirements into the AI prompt
        return """
        CRITICAL SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:
        - Use bcrypt for passwords (min cost 12)
        - Never log sensitive data
        - All tokens must use secrets management
        - Implement rate limiting
        """
    return ""
2. Add Deterministic Test Generation
Problem: AI-generated tests can be flaky or miss edge cases.
Fix: Layer property-based testing with Hypothesis:
python# After OpenAI generates basic tests, add property-based tests
def enhance_tests(test_file):
    # Use AST parsing to find functions being tested
    # Auto-generate Hypothesis strategies for discovered types
    subprocess.run(f"hypothesis write {test_file} --style=pytest")
3. Implement Smart Rollback Points
Problem: Current workflow commits after each step but doesn't track "known good" states.
Fix: Tagged savepoints:
bash# justfile addition
checkpoint name:
    git tag -f "checkpoint/{{name}}"
    git push origin "checkpoint/{{name}}" --force

rollback name:
    git reset --hard "checkpoint/{{name}}"
4. Add Observability & Metrics
Problem: No visibility into what the AI is actually changing over time.
Fix: Structured logging + metrics:
python# Track AI behavior patterns
import json
from datetime import datetime

def log_ai_action(tool, action, metrics):
    with open(".ai-audit.jsonl", "a") as f:
        f.write(json.dumps({
            "timestamp": datetime.utcnow().isoformat(),
            "tool": tool,
            "action": action,
            "files_changed": metrics.get("files_changed", 0),
            "lines_added": metrics.get("lines_added", 0),
            "complexity_delta": metrics.get("complexity_delta", 0)
        }) + "\n")
5. Parallel Validation Pipeline
Problem: Sequential validation is slow.
Fix: Run independent checks in parallel:
python# Run these simultaneously
async def parallel_validate(changed_files):
    tasks = [
        asyncio.create_task(run_ruff(changed_files)),
        asyncio.create_task(run_mypy(changed_files)),
        asyncio.create_task(run_semgrep(changed_files)),
        asyncio.create_task(run_gitleaks())
    ]
    results = await asyncio.gather(*tasks, return_exceptions=True)
    return all(r for r in results if not isinstance(r, Exception))
6. Context-Aware Tool Selection
Problem: Using the same tool chain for every feature type.
Fix: Dynamic pipeline based on change type:
pythonPIPELINES = {
    "api_endpoint": ["ruff", "mypy", "semgrep", "bandit", "hypothesis"],
    "frontend_component": ["prettier", "eslint", "lighthouse-ci"],
    "data_pipeline": ["ruff", "great_expectations", "dbt test"],
    "refactor": ["ruff", "mutmut", "complexity check"]
}

def select_pipeline(feature_description, changed_files):
    # Classify the change type
    if "endpoint" in feature_description or "api" in feature_description:
        return PIPELINES["api_endpoint"]
    # ... more classification logic

TL;DR Improvements

Move security left - Check before generation, not after
Parallelize validation - 5x faster feedback loops
Add property-based testing - Catch edge cases AI misses
Track AI behavior - Structured audit logs
Dynamic pipelines - Different validations for different feature types
Performance gates - Prevent degradation
Complexity budgets - Keep code maintainable

This gets you from "good automation" to "production-grade autonomous development" with safety rails that scale to a team.

Thought for 1m 7s

Love it—this is the right kind of “tightening the bolts.” Your six optimizations are spot-on for turning a clever pipeline into a production system.

Below is a compact, drop-in bundle that implements your ideas end-to-end without getting unwieldy. It gives you: security-left prompts, deterministic+property tests, parallel validators, rollback tags, audit logs, complexity/coverage/perf/license gates, and dynamic pipeline selection.

1) Ready-to-use justfile
# just install:  winget brew/choco, or pipx; then:  just feature desc="Add CSV export API"
set shell := ["bash", "-c"]
set dotenv-load := true

# One command = full autonomous run with guardrails.
feature desc:
	@if [ -z "{{desc}}" ]; then echo "Usage: just feature desc=\"…\""; exit 1; fi
	python scripts/symbiotic.py "{{desc}}"

# Local fast checks (same gates CI uses, minus heavy ones)
validate:
	pre-commit run --all-files

# Performance regression (optional; requires hyperfine)
perf:
	hyperfine --warmup 3 'pytest -q' --export-json .perf.json
	python scripts/check_perf_regression.py .perf.json

# Quick rollback to a tagged checkpoint
rollback name:
	git reset --hard "checkpoint/{{name}}"

# Tag a checkpoint (pre-impl, tested, etc.)
checkpoint name:
	git tag -f "checkpoint/{{name}}"
	git push -f origin "checkpoint/{{name}}"

      - pattern: yaml.load(...)
      - pattern-not: yaml.safe_load(...)

6) Setup (quick)
pip install -U ruff mypy bandit semgrep hypothesis[ghostwriter] radon coverage pip-licenses \
  pre-commit pytest pytest-cov
# optional:
pip install great-expectations
# then:
pre-commit install

Why this matches your “production-optimal” checklist

Security left: manifest-aware prompts inject explicit requirements before any edits land.

Deterministic tests: Codex generates baseline; Hypothesis ghostwriter adds property tests.

Smart checkpoints: checkpoint/pre-impl and checkpoint/tested tags for safe rollback.

Observability: .ai-audit.jsonl records files/lines/complexity deltas per run.

Parallel validation: ruff/mypy/semgrep/bandit/gitleaks run concurrently for fast feedback.

Dynamic pipelines: validators change with the feature type (API vs frontend vs ETL).

Perf, License, Complexity gates: stop regressions that humans usually miss.

If you want, tell me your repo’s folder layout (src/, app/, tests path, schemas) and I’ll tailor these defaults + thresholds (coverage, complexity budget) and produce a PR-ready patch bundle.

You said:
Explain in plain English how this works. Use examples and analogies
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 19s

Here’s the plain-English version, with everyday analogies so you can “see” what’s happening.

The big idea (kitchen analogy)

Think of your repo as a busy restaurant.

Claude is your head chef: great at planning a whole meal and cooking multiple dishes coherently.

Codex is your sous-chef: fast and precise at making specific sides—like test files—exactly to order.

The open-source tools (Ruff, Semgrep, mypy, gitleaks, etc.) are your health inspectors and quality checkers.

The just command is the kitchen manager calling the right people in the right order.

Checkpoints are save points—like snapping a photo of the kitchen before and after the service so you can roll back if needed.

The audit log is the receipt tape / black box recording what happened during service.

What happens when you run just feature desc="Add CSV export API"?
1) Pre-flight: “Are we cooking raw chicken?”

Before anyone cooks, the manager scans the order.
If it mentions risky stuff (auth, tokens, passwords), we paste extra safety rules into the chef’s instructions:

“Use bcrypt,” “don’t log secrets,” “rate-limit” → like a sanitation checklist for higher-risk dishes.

2) Chef (Claude) cooks the main dish

Claude gets a constrained brief:
“Cook only in these kitchens (src/, app/), keep functions small, and when you’re done, print a packing slip listing exactly what you changed.”

That “packing slip” is a JSON manifest (e.g., plan, changed_files, followups).

It’s like the chef leaving a note: “I updated export_controller.py and created csv_utils.py.”

We immediately tag a checkpoint (“pre-impl”)—a save point you can roll back to.

3) Sous-chef (Codex) makes the sides (tests)

Using the packing slip, Codex generates pytest files for the changed modules—precise and quick, like preparing sides to match the main dish.

Then we add Hypothesis property-based tests—think of these as stress tests that keep trying weird inputs to catch edge cases the regular tests missed.

4) Pit-crew validation (in parallel)

Now the pit crew swarms the car—everyone at once:

Ruff: formats + linting (neat plating, clean counters).

mypy/pyright: type checks (labels match containers).

Semgrep & Bandit: security scans (no undercooked code).

gitleaks: secret scanner (no credit cards on the receipt).

Running them in parallel is like five mechanics working at the same time so the car spends less time in the pit.

If anything fails, we give Claude one small repair loop pass: “Fix the issues and re-emit the plan.” If it’s still broken, we stop—no serving bad food.

5) Guardrails (“bouncer at the door”)

Even if checks pass, we scan diffs for forbidden patterns (e.g., eval(, os.system(, DROP TABLE).
If the bouncer sees trouble, nobody gets in.

6) Quality gates (the final exam)

Coverage gate: tests must cover at least X% of the code.

Complexity budget: the code can’t get 20% more complicated than before (like keeping a calorie budget).

License gate: dependencies must use allowed licenses (a quick legal filter).

Performance gate (optional): run the suite and compare lap times (no performance regression).

If all gates pass, we tag another checkpoint (“tested”)—a post-service snapshot.

7) Observability (black box)

We write an entry to .ai-audit.jsonl:
tool, what it did, files changed, lines added, complexity delta—like a flight recorder.
Over time you can ask: “Are features getting bigger? Are we adding complexity? Which tools fix the most issues?”

8) Dynamic pipeline (call the right specialists)

The manager doesn’t call the same crew for every order:

If the change is API/auth, we include Bandit, Semgrep, mypy, gitleaks.

If it’s frontend, we call Prettier + ESLint.

If it’s data/ETL, we might add Great Expectations or dbt test.
This is like summoning the pastry chef only when dessert is ordered.

A concrete example (CSV export endpoint)

You run: just feature desc="Add CSV export endpoint for user data".

Pre-flight sees “export” and “user data” → injects rules: “don’t log PII, validate file paths.”

Claude adds export_controller.py + csv_utils.py, prints a JSON manifest of changed files.

Codex writes tests/test_export_controller.py. Hypothesis adds property tests for CSV rows.

In parallel: Ruff formats, mypy checks types, Semgrep/Bandit scan for insecure file handling, gitleaks looks for secrets.

Coverage ≥ 85%, complexity within +20%, licenses OK, performance within budget → pass.

We tag checkpoint/tested, commit, and log metrics.

Why this feels safe (and fast)

Safe: multiple gates + save points + denylist. You can always roll back.

Fast: validators run in parallel, and property tests catch weird bugs early.

Scalable: the dynamic pipeline brings only the needed specialists, keeping the line moving.

If you want, I can rephrase this flow using your own project’s terms (HUEY_P, File Alchemist, eafix-modular) so the roles and folders match exactly what you see in your repo.

You said:
how many cli tools are apart of this workflow
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 1m 28s

Short answer: 20 CLI tools are part of the bundle I gave you—14 core that power the just feature ... path, plus 6 conditional ones used for frontend/data/perf/local checks.

Core (14)

claude (AI planning/edits)

codex (AI test generation)

git (branches, commits, checkpoints)

just (one-command orchestration)

ruff (format + lint)

mypy (type checking)

semgrep (static/security rules)

bandit (Python security checks)

gitleaks (secrets scanner)

pytest (test runner)

coverage (coverage gate)

hypothesis (property-based tests; ghostwriter)

radon (complexity budget)

pip-licenses (license policy gate)

Conditional (6)

pre-commit (local/CI hook runner; used in just validate)

hyperfine (perf regression check; used in just perf)

prettier (frontend formatting; selected by pipeline)

eslint (frontend linting; selected by pipeline)

great_expectations (data/ETL checks; selected by pipeline)

codespell (docs/spelling; typically via pre-commit)

If you want a tighter core (API/backend-only), you can run with the first 14 and add the conditional ones only when the change type calls for them.

You said:
how does user submit request for work.  what type of request can be sent
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 41s

Great question. You’ve got a few clean ways to “hand the work to the robots.” Pick whichever fits your flow.

How to submit a request
1) Fastest: the CLI

Run one command from your repo root:

just feature desc="Add CSV export endpoint for user data"


That single sentence is your work request.

The orchestrator reads it, injects security rules (if relevant), asks Claude to implement, asks Codex to write tests, then runs the validators/gates.

Tip: Use clear keywords (“api”, “auth”, “frontend”, “etl”, “refactor”)—the pipeline auto-picks the right tool chain based on those words.

2) Pull Request title (hands-off, via CI)

Open a PR and put the request in the title:

Add CSV export endpoint for user data  [type: api_endpoint]


Optionally paste this in the PR body:

# work-request
type: api_endpoint
description: Add /api/users/export as CSV with filtering by created_at.
acceptance:
  - Returns text/csv with header row and ~N records
  - Rejects invalid date range with 400
  - No PII fields in output
constraints:
  - Edit only src/ and app/
  - Coverage >= 85%
risk: medium


The CI job passes the title/description to the orchestrator and runs the whole pipeline.

3) Work-order file (repeatable & auditable)

Drop a YAML file into work_orders/:

# work_orders/2025-09-11_export_csv.yaml
type: api_endpoint
description: Add /api/users/export (CSV) with date filtering and paging.
acceptance:
  - CSV header matches schema v1.2
  - Page size default=100; max=1000
  - Returns 400 for invalid dates; 429 when rate-limited
constraints:
  target_dirs: ["src", "app"]
  forbid: ["os.system(", "eval("]
  coverage_min: 85
notes:
  issue: GH-123
  related_docs: docs/data-export.md


Then run:

python scripts/symbiotic.py "work_orders/2025-09-11_export_csv.yaml"


(If your current script only accepts plain text, you can still paste the YAML into the CLI request, or I can wire the YAML path parsing—easy add.)

What kinds of requests can you send?

Think “what you want done,” not “how to do it.” The system routes to the right checks automatically.

Feature work

api_endpoint: “Add /api/auth/login with JWT”

frontend_component: “Create ProfileCard React component”

data_pipeline: “ETL job moves orders → warehouse daily at 02:00”

cli_tool: “Add users export --csv subcommand”

Quality & maintenance

refactor: “Split data_processing.py into smaller functions”

test_hardening: “Add missing pytest for src/payments”

docs: “Generate module docstrings + MkDocs page for exports”

dependency_update: “Upgrade requests→2.32; regenerate lockfile”

Reliability & security

bugfix: “Fix 500 when CSV has embedded commas”

security_hardening: “Replace yaml.load with safe_load everywhere”

perf_tune: “Reduce p95 latency of export endpoint by 20%”

Data & analytics

schema_change: “Add NOT NULL to users.email; write migration”

validation: “Add Great Expectations checks for orders.csv”

dbt_test: “dbt tests for dim_users keys & freshness”

What a “good” request looks like (tiny template)

Use this checklist (even in plain English):

What: the outcome (one sentence)

Why: business/user value (optional but helpful)

Where: key paths or modules (e.g., src/exports/)

Acceptance: 2–5 bullet points you’ll check

Constraints: limits (coverage ≥ X, don’t touch Y, performance budget)

Risk: low/medium/high (nudges the script to add stricter gates)

Example (API feature, CLI style):

just feature desc="Add /api/users/export CSV with date filters; no PII columns; 400 on bad dates; coverage>=85%"


Example (Bugfix, PR title):

Fix CSV export breaks when names contain commas [type: bugfix]


Body:

acceptance:
  - Exports valid CSV with quoted fields containing commas
  - Adds regression tests for edge cases
constraints:
  coverage_min: 85

What NOT to send

Super vague asks: “make it better” (say what “better” means)

Secrets or tokens (the scanner will block them)

Huge multi-project epics (split into smaller work orders)

TL;DR

Easiest: just feature desc="…"

Team/CI: PR title + (optional) YAML block

Auditable queue: a YAML file in work_orders/

Request types: features, bugfixes, refactors, tests, docs, security, performance, data/ETL, migrations, dependency updates. Add clear acceptance bullets and simple constraints, and the pipeline does the rest.

You said:
i want to use claude or codex
 as the main interface that i work in
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 29s

Awesome—totally doable. You can make Claude Code or Codex CLI your “cockpit” and still keep all the guardrails. Here’s the simplest, production-friendly way to work inside either agent and have them drive your pipeline.

The idea

You open one agent (Claude or Codex) and stay there.

That agent does the planning and file edits.

It either (a) runs safe, allow-listed commands itself, or (b) tells you exactly what to run (one-liners).

Pre-commit + CI gates still enforce quality, coverage, security, etc.

Option A — Claude-first cockpit
1) Start a Claude session with a “house rules” prompt

Create prompts/cockpit.md and paste:

You are my repo cockpit. Rules:
- Edit only in ./src and ./app.
- After any edit, print a compact JSON:
  {"plan":"...", "changed_files":["..."], "followups":["..."]}
- When you need shell, propose a single safe command. Use only these:
  - just validate
  - just perf
  - git status && git add -A && git commit -m "<msg>"
- Security-sensitive work (auth/tokens/passwords): enforce bcrypt≥12, no logging secrets, rate limit, constant-time compares, secrets via env/keystore.
- Don’t use eval(), os.system(), or destructive SQL.


Launch Claude in the repo:

claude -p "$(cat prompts/cockpit.md)"


Now you can send plain English requests like:

“Add /api/users/export CSV endpoint with date filters. No PII in output. Coverage ≥ 85%.”

Claude edits files, then posts the JSON manifest. You reply:

“Run: just validate”

(If you’ve enabled command execution, you can allow it to run the allow-listed command itself.)

Option B — Codex-first cockpit
1) Start Codex with autonomy tuned for file edits

Keep shell actions in suggest/confirm mode; edits in auto-edit:

codex --approval-mode auto-edit -p "
You are my repo cockpit.
- Edit only ./src ./app.
- After edits, emit: {\"plan\":\"...\",\"changed_files\":[...],\"followups\":[...]}.
- For shell, propose one safe command at a time from this allowlist:
  just validate | just perf | git status | git add -A && git commit -m '<msg>'
- Enforce security requirements on auth/tokens/passwords."


Then talk to Codex exactly the same way.

What kinds of requests can you send (inside Claude or Codex)?

Think “what outcome,” not “how.”

Features

“Create /api/auth/login with JWT; lockout after 5 bad attempts.”

“Add ProfileCard React component with avatar + menu.”

Bugfix & hardening

“Fix CSV export when names contain commas; add regression test.”

“Replace yaml.load with safe_load in the repo.”

Refactor & quality

“Split data_processing.py into small pure functions; add docstrings.”

“Generate unit tests for src/payments (edge cases too).”

Data/ETL

“Add daily ETL job, validate schema with Great Expectations.”

Docs

“Generate docstrings for src/exports/* and a docs page.”

Tip: sprinkle intent words (“api”, “auth”, “frontend”, “etl”, “refactor”)—your dynamic pipeline uses these to pick the right validators.

How the cockpit drives the guardrails (in practice)

You (in Claude/Codex):
“Add CSV export endpoint. No PII. Coverage ≥ 85%.”

Agent does:

Plans and edits code.

Emits JSON:

{"plan":"...","changed_files":["src/export_controller.py","src/csv_utils.py"],"followups":["edge case tests"]}


You reply:
“Run: just validate”

That one command triggers:

Ruff/mypy/Semgrep/Bandit/gitleaks in parallel

Pytest + coverage gate

(Optional) perf and license checks

If anything fails, tell the agent:
“Apply fixes to satisfy lints/security and make tests pass.”

When all green:
“Run: git add -A && git commit -m 'feat: CSV export endpoint'
Run: just perf (optional)
Tag checkpoint: just checkpoint name=tested”

Make it smooth (tiny setup that pays off)

Allowlist the safe commands (so the agent can execute them without prompting):

just validate

pytest -q

git add -A && git commit -m "<msg>"

just perf (if perf gate enabled)

Keep everything else as “suggest only.”
That keeps the agent your main interface without giving it a blank check on the shell.

Pre-commit installed: it runs locally and in CI, so whether the agent edits or you do, the same gates fire.

Cheatsheet you can paste to start a session

Claude (recommended starter):

claude -p "
You’re my repo cockpit. Edit only ./src ./app. After edits, emit JSON {plan,changed_files,followups}.
Security on auth/tokens/passwords: bcrypt>=12, no secret logging, constant-time compares, rate limit, secrets via env.
Shell allowlist: just validate | just perf | git status | git add -A && git commit -m '<msg>'.
"


Codex:

codex --approval-mode auto-edit -p "
You’re my repo cockpit. Same rules as above. For shell, propose only allowlisted commands.
"


Then type requests like:

“Add /api/users/export CSV with date filters; no PII; coverage≥85%.”

“Refactor data_processing.py for readability; add property tests.”

TL;DR

Open Claude or Codex once and treat it like your cockpit.

Give it a short house-rules prompt (paths, JSON manifest, security, allowlisted commands).

Speak in outcomes; let it edit files.

Use just validate (or have the agent run it) to trigger all gates.

Commit/tag when green.

If you want, tell me which one you prefer (Claude or Codex) and your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux), and I’ll give you a 60-second, copy-paste starter tailored to your machine.

how can i see what's happening as it happenes
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 1m 2s

Great question. You’ve got three good ways to “watch the robot’s hands” in real time:

1) See everything in the terminal (live streaming)

Goal: every command prints as it runs, without waiting.

Run Python unbuffered so logs stream:

PYTHONUNBUFFERED=1 just feature desc="Add CSV export API"


If you call tools from Python, use a streaming runner (no buffering). In our symbiotic.py, swap the run() helper to a line-by-line streamer:

import subprocess, sys

def run_stream(cmd, cwd=ROOT, check=True):
    print(f"\n$ {cmd}", flush=True)
    p = subprocess.Popen(cmd, cwd=cwd, shell=True, text=True,
                         stdout=subprocess.PIPE, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT)
    ok = True
    for line in iter(p.stdout.readline, ''):
        sys.stdout.write(line)   # prints as it happens
        sys.stdout.flush()
    rc = p.wait()
    if check and rc != 0:
        raise SystemExit(f"Command failed: {cmd}")
    return rc


Then replace calls of run(...) with run_stream(...) for the steps you want to watch (ruff, mypy, semgrep, pytest, etc.).

Windows tip: run from Windows Terminal/PowerShell; use python -u scripts\symbiotic.py "…".
Mac/Linux tip: if a tool still buffers, prefix with stdbuf -oL -eL (e.g., stdbuf -oL semgrep --config=auto .).

2) Keep a side “dashboard” open (logs, diffs, tests)

Goal: a second window shows live changes and metrics—like a pit wall during the race.

Live AI audit log

Mac/Linux:

tail -f .ai-audit.jsonl | jq -r '.event | "\(.tool): \(.action) | files=\(.files_changed) lines=+\(.lines_added) Δcomplexity=\(.complexity_delta)"'


Windows PowerShell:

Get-Content .ai-audit.jsonl -Wait | ForEach-Object {
  $e = $_ | ConvertFrom-Json
  "{0}: {1} | files={2} lines=+{3} Δcomplexity={4}" -f $e.event.tool,$e.event.action,$e.event.files_changed,$e.event.lines_added,$e.event.complexity_delta
}


See diffs update every second

Mac/Linux:

watch -n 1 'git --no-pager diff --stat'


Windows PowerShell:

while ($true) { git --no-pager diff --stat; Start-Sleep 1; Clear-Host }


Auto-rerun tests on file changes (tight loop)

Mac/Linux:

ls $(git ls-files '*.py' '*.js') | entr -c pytest -q


Windows: use watchexec (scoop/choco) or VS Code Test Watch.

Power user: put these in a tmux session: pane 1 = orchestrator, pane 2 = audit tail, pane 3 = diff watch, pane 4 = pytest -f (fail-fast) so you always see the first failing test.

3) Ask the agent to narrate

Goal: Claude/Codex tells you what it’s doing, step by step.

Add these two lines to your cockpit prompt:

- Narrate each phase briefly: PLAN → EDITS → TESTS → VALIDATION → RESULTS.
- After edits, always emit JSON: {"plan":"...", "changed_files":[...], "followups":[...]}.


Examples of what you’ll see scroll by:

PLAN: “Create export_controller.py, add csv_utils.py.”

EDITS: “Edited 2 files; added 120 lines.”

TESTS: “Request: run just validate.”

VALIDATION: “Ruff/mypy/Semgrep pass; coverage 87%.”

RESULTS: “Ready to commit; follow-ups: rate-limit tuning.”

Optional: one-command monitors

Add to your justfile:

logs:
	tail -f .ai-audit.jsonl

diffs:
	watch -n 1 'git --no-pager diff --stat'

monitor:
	@echo "Pane 1: logs | Pane 2: diffs"; \
	( tail -f .ai-audit.jsonl ) & ( watch -n 1 'git --no-pager diff --stat' )


Then run just monitor in a second terminal while the feature pipeline runs in the first.

TL;DR

Stream output (unbuffered Python + line-by-line Popen) to see every step live.

Open a side dashboard: tail the AI audit log and watch diffs/tests update continuously.

Make the agent narrate its phases and always print the changed_files manifest so you know exactly what just happened.

Absolutely—VS Code works great as the cockpit for this system. You can stay inside VS Code, drive Claude or Codex, and keep live panels open for logs, diffs, tests, and validation.

Below is a drop-in .vscode/ setup that gives you:

a “Feature (prompt)” command that asks what you want and runs the whole pipeline,

a Dashboard that opens live terminals for audit logs, git diffs, and test watch,

good defaults for Ruff/mypy/pytest and friends,

recommended extensions so lint errors show in the Problems panel and tests in the Testing view.

(If you do frontend work: add esbenp.prettier-vscode and dbaeumer.vscode-eslint.)

4) How you’ll use it in VS Code (day to day)

Kick off work: Terminal → Run Task → Feature (prompt)
VS Code will prompt for the feature sentence, then stream the whole run (Claude → Codex → validators) in a dedicated terminal.

Open the live dashboard: Terminal → Run Task → Open Dashboard
You’ll see three terminals:

AI audit log (live): what the agent changed, lines added, complexity delta

Git diffs (live): a running summary of file changes

Test watch: re-runs tests on edit; shows failures immediately

Watch errors in real-time in the Problems panel (Ruff/mypy/pytest diagnostics go here via extensions).

See & run tests in the Testing sidebar (click individual tests, re-run failed).

Use the agent cockpit right in VS Code: Run Task → Cockpit: Claude (or Codex) opens an interactive terminal where you can talk to the agent without leaving VS Code.

Commit & checkpoints in the Source Control view (stage, commit; or run your checkpoint task/command).

5) Optional niceties

Keybindings: bind Feature (prompt) and Open Dashboard to hotkeys (Preferences → Keyboard Shortcuts).

Task icons: you can add "icon": "tools" (VS Code Insiders supports task icons).

Problem matchers: if you want lint/test output to highlight directly in Problems from tasks (instead of via extensions), we can wire custom problem matchers for ruff, mypy, pytest, and semgrep.

TL;DR

Yes—use VS Code as your IDE interface. The config above gives you:

a one-click Feature runner,

a split-terminal Dashboard (logs + diffs + tests),

Problems & Testing views wired to your validators,

and an in-terminal Claude/Codex cockpit so you never leave VS Code.

If you tell me your OS (Windows/macOS/Linux) and whether you want Claude-first or Codex-first, I’ll tailor the monitoring commands for your shell and drop you a ready-to-paste .vscode/ folder.

Yep—here’s a Windows-ready VS Code setup so you can stay in the IDE and watch everything live (logs, diffs, tests) while Claude or Codex do the work.

  ]
}

.vscode/settings.json (Windows-friendly defaults)
{
  "python.testing.pytestEnabled": true,
  "python.testing.pytestArgs": ["-q"],
  "python.analysis.typeCheckingMode": "basic",
  "ruff.enable": true,
  "editor.formatOnSave": true,
  "editor.codeActionsOnSave": { "source.fixAll": true },
  "terminal.integrated.defaultProfile.windows": "PowerShell",
  "files.exclude": { "**/__pycache__": true, ".pytest_cache": true, ".venv": true }

    "dbaeumer.vscode-eslint"
  ]
}


Optional: prompts\\cockpit.md can hold your “house rules” for Claude/Codex (paths, JSON manifest, allowlisted commands).

2) How you use it (all inside VS Code)

Kick off work: Terminal → Run Task → Feature (prompt) → type your request

Open live dashboard: Terminal → Run Task → Open Dashboard

AI audit log: real-time summary of what the agent changed

Git diffs: rolling diff --stat

Test watch: re-runs tests on each edit

Agent cockpit: Run Task → Cockpit: Claude (or Codex) to chat/drive edits directly in a terminal

Problems panel: see ruff/mypy/pytest diagnostics update live

Testing view: run individual tests, re-run failed

3) Quick install hints (Windows)

Python 3.11+ & Git: via Microsoft Store/winget

just: winget install sharkdp.just

Python tools:

pip install -U ruff mypy semgrep bandit pytest pytest-cov hypothesis[ghostwriter] radon coverage pip-licenses pre-commit


(Optional) gitleaks: winget install Gitleaks.Gitleaks

Ensure claude or codex CLIs are on your PATH.

That’s it—you can run the whole workflow, watch it live, and never leave VS Code on Windows. If you want, tell me whether you prefer Claude-first or Codex-first, and your repo’s folder names (src, app, etc.); I’ll tweak the commands to match perfectly.

You said:
i have codex and claude but i dont know about the others, can they be installed and configured
ChatGPT said:
Thought for 41s

Yes. We can install and wire up everything on Windows so you work in VS Code with Codex/Claude as your cockpit and the OSS tools as guardrails.

Below is a single, idempotent PowerShell bootstrap that:

Installs the missing CLIs (via winget, pip, npm)

Creates a Python virtualenv

Drops VS Code tasks, settings, and a justfile

Adds pre-commit + ruff/mypy/semgrep/bandit/pytest/etc.

Sets up the audit log + monitors

1) Copy–paste installer (PowerShell)

Run it from your repo root in PowerShell (not CMD):
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass; ./bootstrap.ps1 (after saving it)

$ErrorActionPreference = "Stop"

2) What this installs & configures

Core CLIs

Python toolchain: ruff, mypy, pytest, coverage, hypothesis[ghostwriter], bandit, semgrep, radon, pip-licenses, pre-commit, codespell, check-jsonschema, great-expectations

Native helpers: git, just, hyperfine, gitleaks

Frontend (optional): prettier, eslint

VS Code

Tasks for: Feature (prompt), Validate, Perf, Open Dashboard (live audit log + diffs + test watch)

Settings to show lint/test results in Problems + Testing views

Repo config

pyproject.toml (ruff + pytest/coverage gate)

.pre-commit-config.yaml (runs all checks locally/CI)

justfile (one-liners to run the pipeline)

scripts/check_perf_regression.py (perf gate helper)

3) How to use (in VS Code)

Open Dashboard: Terminal → Run Task → Open Dashboard (live logs/diffs/tests)

Kick off work: Terminal → Run Task → Feature (prompt) → type your request

Validate quickly: Terminal → Run Task → Validate (fast)

Perf gate (optional): Terminal → Run Task → Perf Gate

You can still drive everything from Codex or Claude terminals (your cockpit) and just run just validate between edits.

Notes / fallback

If winget is blocked, you can substitute Chocolatey:

choco install git python nodejs-lts gitleaks hyperfine just

If Node wasn’t on PATH, restart VS Code/Terminal and re-run the npm bits.

If you want, tell me your repo’s exact folder names (src, app, etc.) and I’ll tune the default coverage targets, directories, and tasks for that layout.
