If you want VS Code to be the primary cockpit (no context‑switching), here’s a concrete, soup‑to‑nuts way to do it—what to build, where each piece lives, and exactly how the Webview, tasks, and profiles snap together.

A. Custom VS Code Extension (Webview “Job Console”)
What it gives pastedDWhat is this:EditDecoded VS Code extension for AI agent orchestration system.Looking at this document, this appears to be a detailed technical specification for building a VS Code extension that integrates with some kind of AI agent orchestration system. Let me break down what I'm seeing:

The document is describing how to create a custom VS Code extension called "Orchestrator Console" that acts as a "cockpit" for managing AI agents/jobs
It's designed to work with a FastAPI backend system that manages different AI agents (gemini, claude, aider, etc.)
The extension provides a webview interface within VS Code for:

Viewing job queues
Monitoring logs
Previewing diffs
Approving and committing changes with guards



The document includes:

Complete code samples for the VS Code extension (TypeScript, HTML, CSS, JS)
Configuration for VS Code profiles for different workflows (Refactor, Docs, Release)
Task automation setup
Security and UX considerations

This seems to be a companion document to the Agentic Framework files we looked at earlier - it's describing how to build a VS Code frontend/interface for that AI orchestration system.
The key innovation seems to be keeping all the AI agent logic in a separate FastAPI service while having VS Code act as the primary interface where developers can:

Submit tasks to AI agents
Monitor progress
Review changes
Approve commits with safety guards
All without leaving their main development environment (VS Code)
This is a detailed technical specification for building a VS Code extension that serves as a "cockpit" or frontend interface for the Agentic Framework v3.0 system we just analyzed.
🎯 What It Does
Transforms VS Code into a complete AI development orchestration interface where developers can:

Submit tasks to AI agents (Gemini, Claude, Aider, etc.) directly from VS Code
Monitor job queues and see real-time status of running AI tasks
Review code changes with built-in diff viewers
Approve and commit changes with safety guards (tests, linting, size limits)
Switch between development modes using VS Code profiles (Refactor, Docs, Release)

🏗️ Architecture Components
A. Custom VS Code Extension (orchestrator-console)

Webview Panel: Job queue interface showing pending/running/awaiting-approval tasks
API Client: Communicates with the FastAPI backend from agentic_framework_v3.py
Diff Integration: Opens file diffs directly in VS Code's native diff viewer
One-click Actions: "Approve & Commit (Guarded)" button that triggers safety checks

B. VS Code Profiles for Different Work Modes

Refactor Profile: GitLens, strong linting, Claude Code for complex changes
Docs Profile: Markdown tools, Copilot for documentation, relaxed diff limits
Release Profile: Version management, conventional commits, changelog tools

C. Task Automation System
json{
  "workflow:triage→agent→commit": [
    "run diagnostics",
    "execute AI agent",
    "run guarded commit"
  ]
}
D. Safety Guards

Tests must pass before any commit
Diff size limits (blocks commits over threshold)
Manual review required for large changes
No direct Git writes from extension (only via guard script)

🔄 User Experience Flow
1. Developer works in VS Code
   ↓
2. Presses Ctrl+Shift+R (custom keybinding)
   ↓
3. VS Code shows agent picker: "Refactor with Claude" / "Document with Copilot"
   ↓
4. Task submitted to FastAPI backend (agentic_framework_v3.py)
   ↓
5. Extension webview shows job progress in real-time
   ↓
6. AI completes task → Extension shows diff preview
   ↓
7. Developer clicks "Approve & Commit (Guarded)"
   ↓
8. Safety checks run → Auto-commit if passed
🎨 Visual Interface
The extension creates a side panel in VS Code showing:
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│ 🤖 Orchestrator Console         │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Jobs:                           │
│ ⏳ claude_code - refactor auth  │
│ ✅ gemini_cli - fix typos      │
│ 🔄 aider_local - add tests     │
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│ Selected Job Details:           │
│ 📋 Logs: "Analyzing code..."    │
│ 📂 Files Changed: auth.py (+15/-3) │
│ 🔍 [Open Diff] [Approve & Commit] │
└─────────────────────────────────┘
💡 Why This Approach
Problem It Solves:

Context switching: Instead of terminal → web browser → VS Code, everything stays in VS Code
Safety: Prevents direct AI commits; forces human approval + safety checks
Workflow optimization: Different VS Code setups for different types of work
Visibility: Real-time monitoring of AI agent work

Key Innovation:
"Zero context-switching AI development" - developers never leave VS Code but get full orchestration capabilities with enterprise-grade safety controls.
🔗 Integration with Agentic Framework
This VS Code extension is the frontend client for the agentic_framework_v3.py system:

FastAPI backend handles AI routing, cost optimization, quota management
VS Code extension provides the user interface and approval workflow
Safety guards ensure code quality and prevent runaway AI changes

🎯 Target User
Professional developers who:

Live in VS Code all day
Want AI assistance but with human oversight
Need different workflows for different types of tasks
Require enterprise-grade safety and auditability
Want cost optimization without thinking about it

Bottom line: This turns VS Code into a complete AI development cockpit while maintaining all the cost optimization and safety features of the underlying Agentic Framework.RetryDWhat in this system is not fully implemented and still needs modificationsEditUnearthed numerous gaps in Agentic Framework v3.0 implementation.16sThe user is asking about what parts of this Agentic Framework v3.0 system are not fully implemented and still need work. Let me analyze the files and documentation to identify gaps between the vision/specification and actual implementation.
Looking at the files provided:

agentic_framework_v3.py - This looks like a fairly complete implementation with:

CostOptimizedServiceRouter
TaskComplexityAnalyzer
CostOptimizedQuotaManager
DevAgentCrew (CrewAI)
LangGraphWorkflowEngine
FastAPI endpoints
CLI interface



But I need to look for what's missing or incomplete...

The VS Code extension (from the last document) - This is just a specification, not implemented code
Git integration - langgraph_git_integration.py exists but may not be fully integrated
Monitoring setup - docker-compose has Prometheus/Grafana but the configs aren't provided
Actual AI service integrations - The code has placeholders but may not have real implementations
Testing - noxfile.py exists but actual test files aren't provided

Let me identify the gaps:
Not Implemented:

VS Code Extension - Just specs, no actual code
Actual AI service clients (Gemini, Claude, Aider, Ollama integration)
Real CrewAI agent implementations
Monitoring configurations (prometheus.yml, grafana dashboards)
Git worktree integration with the main system
Test suites
Safety guard scripts (commit_guard.sh)
Real database persistence
Production deployment configs
Authentication/authorization

Partially Implemented:

LangGraph workflows - framework is there but specific workflows may be incomplete
Cost tracking - Redis structure exists but may need refinement
Service routing logic - basic implementation but may need tuning
CLI interface - basic structure but may need more commands

I'll focus on the CLI interface's current limitations. The existing command-line tool appears to have a rudimentary structure, lacking comprehensive functionality. It likely needs expanded commands for workflow management, service configuration, and system diagnostics. The current implementation probably supports only basic operations, missing advanced features like detailed logging, complex workflow orchestration, and comprehensive system introspection capabilities.Looking at the Agentic Framework v3.0 system, here's what's not fully implemented and still needs work:

    # ❌ No ML-based classification
    # ❌ No learning from past classifications
    # ❌ No context-aware analysis (file types, project size)
14. Service Selection Algorithm
pythonasync def select_optimal_service(...) -> ServiceType:
    # ✅ Basic priority + quota checking
    # ❌ No performance history consideration
    # ❌ No dynamic pricing optimization
    # ❌ No service health monitoring
15. Error Handling & Recovery
python# Throughout the codebase:
# ❌ No circuit breaker patterns
# ❌ No automatic retry with backoff
# ❌ No graceful degradation
# ❌ No rollback mechanisms
🚀 Development Priority Order
Phase 1: Core Functionality (2-3 weeks)

Real AI service clients - Get Gemini/Claude/Aider actually working
Basic git integration - Connect worktrees to task execution
Safety guards - Implement commit_guard.sh and pre-commit hooks
Database operations - Create/read/update workflow executions

Phase 2: User Interface (2-3 weeks)

VS Code extension - Build the webview console and task integration
Monitoring setup - Create Prometheus/Grafana configurations
Test suite - Unit and integration tests

Phase 3: Production Ready (2-4 weeks)

Advanced error handling - Circuit breakers, retries, rollbacks
Security - Authentication, authorization, input validation
Performance optimization - Caching, async improvements
Documentation - API docs, deployment guides

💡 Current State Assessment
What Works Now:

Basic CLI interface and API endpoints
Cost calculation and quota structure
Docker containerization
Framework integrations (CrewAI, LangGraph, FastAPI)

What's Missing:

Actual AI functionality (it's all placeholder code)
User interface (VS Code extension)
Safety systems (commit guards, testing)
Production monitoring and error handling

Bottom Line: The architecture and framework integration is solid, but 80% of the actual implementation work remains. It's like having a beautiful blueprint and foundation, but the house isn't built yet.
