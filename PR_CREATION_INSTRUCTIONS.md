## Purpose
This PR consolidates updates by merging the `feat/mods-integration-and-phase-plan` branch into `main` to establish main as the single source of truth. This is part of a branch cleanup effort to consolidate development work.

## Summary of Changes
The feature branch contains **140 commits** with substantial development history including:

- **CLI Orchestrator Stack**: Complete CLI orchestrator stack with tool integration layer
- **AI Adapters Framework**: Comprehensive adapter framework with VS Code extension
- **Enhanced Features**: Analysis/planning scripts, schemas, and VS Code commands
- **Repository Normalization**: Line ending fixes and cleanup

## Merge Conflict Resolution
A merge conflict exists in `pyproject.toml`:

- **Main branch**: version "1.1.0" with BOM character
- **Feature branch**: version "1.0.0" without BOM character

**Resolution Strategy**:
1. Keep version "1.1.0" from main (maintain version progression)
2. Remove BOM character (prefer feature branch format)
3. Retain all other feature branch content

## Notes
- **No additional code changes** are introduced by this PR beyond the merge
- **All changes are existing work** from the feature branch being consolidated
- **Build and tests** should be validated after merge
- **140 commits** represent substantial development work being consolidated
