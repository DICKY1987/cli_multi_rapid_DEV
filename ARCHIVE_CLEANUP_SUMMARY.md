3. **archive/feature-tool-integration-framework-2025-09-23**
   - Target Commit: `5c57ae3144c10c5332f3198619b18e3edcf4343f`
   - Original Branch: `feature/tool-integration-framework`

   - Description: "feat: refactor CLI entrypoint and tests Point console script to cli_multi_rapid.cli_app:app"

### Branches to be Deleted

The following branches are marked for deletion from the remote repository:

1. `clean-main`
2. `recovery/ffcfdf0-safe-refactor`
3. `feature/tool-integration-framework`
4. `copilot/fix-f6b66ced-8f93-4cd0-9314-d5b62a3e4f76`

### Implementation Status

✅ **Completed:**
- All 4 archive tags created locally
- Commits verified and tagged correctly
- Branch names and commit hashes validated against GitHub API
- Shell script created for final execution

⚠️ **Pending (requires authentication):**
- Push archive tags to remote repository
- Delete branches from remote repository

### Commands to Complete the Task

If running this manually with proper authentication, execute:

```bash
# Push archive tags
git push origin --tags

# Delete remote branches
git push origin --delete clean-main
git push origin --delete recovery/ffcfdf0-safe-refactor
git push origin --delete feature/tool-integration-framework
git push origin --delete copilot/fix-f6b66ced-8f93-4cd0-9314-d5b62a3e4f76
```

Or simply run the provided script:
```bash
./archive_and_cleanup_branches.sh
```

### Verification

After completion, verify:
1. Archive tags exist on GitHub: `git ls-remote --tags origin | grep archive`
2. Branches are deleted: `git ls-remote --heads origin | grep -E "(clean-main|recovery|feature.*tool|copilot.*fix)"`

### Safety Notes

- All commits are preserved in archive tags before branch deletion
- Tags follow naming convention: `archive/{branch-name}-2025-09-23`
- Original commit hashes are exactly as specified in the requirements
- No data loss will occur as commits remain accessible via tags

### Files Created

- `archive_and_cleanup_branches.sh` - Automated script to complete the task
- `ARCHIVE_CLEANUP_SUMMARY.md` - This documentation file

The archive and cleanup process preserves all historical work while removing the specified branches as requested.
